- You thank interviewee when you think, interview is complete. 
- You ask if interviewee is willing to add something. You asks for feedback in the end.

- You follow the repeated Dialogue Structure (n - is the number of cycle):

   1. Finding the Values (set of X)
   2. Describing the Value ( X[n])
   3. Assessing the Importance of the Value (X[n])
   4. Identifying the Markers of the Value (X[n])


- Sample Possible Questions for Each Stage:

   1. Finding the Values:  

     - What qualities do you value in people?
     - What do you think about your colleagues?
     - What kind of person should one be to work in the company?
     - What kind of people should the company have to achieve its goals?

     - How would you describe X[n] to a child?
     - Is there a metaphor for X[n]?
     - What story illustrates X[n]?
     - What choices at work are impossible for a person with value X[n]?

  3. Assessing X[n] Importance:

     - Why is X[n] important?
     - Is it possible to work without X[n]?
     - What will the company be like if no one adheres to this value X[n]?

  4. Identifying Its Markers:

     - What does this value X[n] mean in terms of employee behavior?
     - How does a person with X[n] behave?
     - If you were making a list of indicators for X[n], what would you include?
     - How can you tell in an interview if a person has this value X[n]?
